This is an *unofficial* API for Plynk. It is a simple Python wrapper around the Plynk backend API. **It is not affiliated with Plynk in any way**.

## Installation üçá

```bash
pip install 'plynk-api'
```

## Logging In üçÖ

```python
from plynk_api import Plynk

plynk = Plynk(
    username="USERNAME",
    password="PASSWORD",
    filename="plynk-creds.pkl",
    path="creds", 
    proxy_url=None,  # Takes "URL:PORT"
    proxy_auth=None # Takes ("USERNAME", "PASSWORD")
)
try:
    plynk.login()
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to login to Plynk: {e}")
```

## Get Account Number ü•ë

```python
try:
    account_number = plynk.get_account_number()
    print(account_number)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to get Plynk account number: {e}")
```

## Get Stock Holdings ü•≠

```python
try:
    holdings = plynk.get_account_holdings(account_number=account_number)
    for holding in holdings:
        stock_symbol = holding['security']['symbol']
        current_value = holding['currentValue']
        holding_quantity = holding['securityCount']
        print(f"Stock Symbol: {stock_symbol}, Quantity {holding_quantity}, Current Value: {current_value}")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to get Plynk holdings: {e}")
```

## Get Account Total Value üçñ

```python
try:
    account_total = plynk.get_account_total(account_number=account_number)
    print(f"Account Total: {account_total}")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to get Plynk account total: {e}")
```

## Search for Stock üç≠
```python
try:
    search_result = plynk.get_stock_search(query="AA")
    for stock in search_result["securities"]:
        print(f"Stock: {stock["symbol"]}")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to get Plynk stock search: {e}")
```

## Exact Stock Search Result ü•ï
Using the `get_stock_search()` function, when a ticker is provided and the `exact=` parameter is passed, the details
of the specified stock will be returned.
```python
try:
    result = plynk.get_stock_search(query="AAPL", exact=True)
    print(f"Security Type: {result["securityType"]}")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to get exact Plynk search results: {e}")
```

## Placing Orders üçâ

There are two ways to place an order in Plynk, specifying a dollar amount to buy/sell, or specifying a quantity to buy/sell.

When buying stocks under $1 price, the user is required to specify a dollar amount instead of specifying a quantity.

### Placing orders by price ü•ù
```python
try: 
    order = plynk.place_order_price(
        account_number=account_number, 
        ticker="AAPL", 
        quantity=350.50,  # Buy $350.50 worth of AAPL
        side="buy",  # Must be "buy" or "sell"
        price="market",  # Only market orders are supported for now
        dry_run=False # If True, will not actually place the order
    )
    print(order)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to place price order: {e}")
```

### Placing orders by quantity üåÆ 
```python
try:
    order = plynk.place_order_quantity(
        account_number=account_number, 
        ticker="AAPL", 
        quantity=2,  # Sell 2 shares worth of AAPL
        side="sell",  # Must be "buy" or "sell"
        price="market",  # Only market orders are supported for now
        dry_run=False # If True, will not actually place the order
    )
    print(order)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to place quantity order: {e}")
```

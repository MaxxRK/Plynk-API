This is an *unofficial* API for Plynk. It is a simple Python wrapper around the Plynk backend API. **It is not affiliated with Plynk in any way**.

## Installation üçá

```bash
pip install 'plynk-api'
```

## Logging In üçÖ

```python
from plynk_api import Plynk

plynk = Plynk(
    username="USERNAME",
    password="PASSWORD",
    filename="plynk-creds.pkl",
    path="creds", 
    proxy_url=None,  # Takes "URL:PORT"
    proxy_auth=None # Takes ("USERNAME", "PASSWORD")
)
try:
    plynk.login()
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to login to Plynk: {e}")
```

## Get Account Number ü•ë

```python
try:
    account_number = plynk.get_account_number()
    print(account_number)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to get Plynk account number: {e}")
```

## Get Stock Holdings ü•≠

```python
try:
    holdings = plynk.get_stock_holdings(account_number=account_number)
    for holding in holdings:
        stock_symbol = holding['security']['symbol']
        current_value = holding['currentValue']
        holding_quantity = holding['securityCount']
        print(f"Stock Symbol: {stock_symbol}, Quantity {holding_quantity}, Current Value: {current_value}")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to get Plynk holdings: {e}")
```

## Placing Orders üçâ

There are two ways to place an order in Plynk, specifying a dollar amount to buy/sell, or specifying a quantity to buy/sell.

When buying stocks under $1 price, the user is required to specify a dollar amount instead of specifying a quantity.

### Placing orders by price ü•ù
```python
try: 
    order = plynk.place_order_price(
        account_number=account_number, 
        ticker="AAPL", 
        quantity=350.50,  # Buy $350.50 worth of AAPL
        side="buy",  # Must be "buy" or "sell"
        price="market",  # Only market orders are supported for now
        dry_run=False # If True, will not actually place the order
    )
    print(order)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to place price order: {e}")
```

### Placing orders by quantity ü•ï
```python
try:
    order = plynk.place_order_quantity(
        account_number=account_number, 
        ticker="AAPL", 
        quantity=2,  # Sell 2 shares worth of AAPL
        side="sell",  # Must be "buy" or "sell"
        price="market",  # Only market orders are supported for now
        dry_run=False # If True, will not actually place the order
    )
    print(order)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Failed to place quantity order: {e}")
```
